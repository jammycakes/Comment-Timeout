Closes comments on blog entries after a user-configurable period of time, with an option to make allowances for active discussions.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically closes comments on blog entries after a user-
configurable period of time. It has options which allow you to keep the
discussion open for longer on older posts which have had recent comments
accepted, or to place a fixed limit on the total number of comments in
the discussion. The latest version also allows you to block excessive
hyperlinks in posts, or to shut off comments and trackbacks to IP
addresses that have been reported by your spam queue or by Bad Behavior
as particularly problematic.

== Installation ==

* Copy the file `CommentTimeout.php` to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
* Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in the WordPress dashboard.
* Configure the plugin by going to the "Comment Timeout" page on the "Options" menu.

== Configuration ==

You can change various settings on the "Comment Timeout" page under the
"Options" tab on the WordPress dashboard.

The default settings are to disable comments and trackbacks on all posts
older than four months that have not had a comment for more than two months,
with no overall limit on the number of comments.
