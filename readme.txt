Closes comments on blog entries after a user-configurable period of time, with an option to make allowances for active discussions.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically closes comments on blog entries after a user-
configurable period of time. It has options which allow you to keep the
discussion open for longer on older posts which have had recent comments
accepted, or to override the timeout on a post-by-post basis.

== Installation ==

* Copy the directory `comment-timeout` and all the files in it into your
`/wp-content/plugins` directory.
* Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in the WordPress dashboard.
* Configure the plugin by going to the "Comment Timeout" page on the "Options" menu.

== Configuration ==

You can change various settings globally on the "Comment Timeout" page under the
"Options" tab on the WordPress dashboard. Most of the options are fairly
self-explanatory.

You can also change options on a per-post basis by looking for the 
"Comment Timeout" section in the sidebar of the post or page editor.
